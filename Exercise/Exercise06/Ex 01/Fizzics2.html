<H2>Turning Gold into Lead</H2>
In a startling breakthrough, scientist B.O. "Gus" Fizzics has 
invented a <STRONG>practical</STRONG> technique for transmutation! 
For more details, please see <A href="give-us-your-gold.html">our 
    transmutation thesis</A>.
<H2>Perpetual Inactivity Machine</H2>
In a radical approach that turned traditional attempts to develop 
perpetual motion machines on their heads, Prof. Fizzics has 
developed a verified, bona fide perpetual inaction machine. To
